INNER JOIN skills_job_dim
    ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim
    ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5;


SELECT
    skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim
    ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim
    ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
